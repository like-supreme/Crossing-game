# Crossing-game
This is a classic arcade-style game built with Python's `turtle` module, inspired by Frogger. The player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy street full of moving cars. With each successful crossing, the game gets harder. Reach the top, dodge traffic, and survive as long as you can!
